# Projects & Labs

### 1. Continuous MFA: Smart Student Authentication (Final Year Project)

**Goal:** Developed an adaptive, **Behaviour-based Multi-Factor Authentication (BMFA)** system to secure student data platforms by verifying user identity **beyond the initial login by typing activity**.

**Tools Used:**
<span class="label label-danger">Python</span>
<span class="label label-warning">PostgreSQL</span>
<span class="label label-success">k-NN Algorithm</span>
<span class="label label-info">pynput / scikit-learn</span>

**Innovation & Outcome:**
The system uses **keystroke dynamics** (typing rhythm biometrics) to create a unique user profile.It implements the **K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm** for real-time, continuous monitoring, detecting anomalies, and preventing unauthorized data access or modification with refrence to sensitive tasks.

## Continuing Projects

### Cloud Security Monitoring (AWS/Azure)
**Goal:** Integrate cloud environment logs (e.g., S3/Blob storage access) into a central SIEM platform for unified visibility.

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning
**Goal:** Implement a recurring vulnerability assessment workflow using tools like OpenVAS or Nessus to continuously audit internal infrastructure.

## Lab Challenges & CTF (TryHackMe & HTB)

### Active Challenges
* **TryHackMe:** Currently focusing on the **SOC Level 1 Path** (Focusing on network analysis and SIEM fundamentals).
* **CTF Focus:** Practicing common web application vulnerabilities (Injection, XSS) and basic privilege escalation techniques.
