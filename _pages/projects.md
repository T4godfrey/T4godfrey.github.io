# Projects & Labs Showcase

## Completed Work

### 1. Home Lab Network Infrastructure
**Goal:** Design and implement a secure, segmented network for a small business environment.

**Tools Used:**
<span class="label label-danger">Cisco Packet Tracer</span>
<span class="label label-success">pfSense</span>
<span class="label label-warning">Wireshark</span>
<span class="label label-info">VLANs</span>

**Outcome:**
Successfully demonstrated network segmentation principles and firewall policy management, ensuring data isolation between Guest, Employee, and Server networks.

<blockquote class="blockquote-success">
  <i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> **Key Result:** Proven capability in implementing and managing security and networking policies via pfSense.

### 2. Continuous MFA: Smart Student Authentication (Final Year Project)

[cite_start]**Goal:** Developed an adaptive, **Continuous Multi-Factor Authentication (CMFA)** system to secure student data platforms by verifying user identity **beyond the initial login**[cite: 408, 432].

**Tools Used:**
<span class="label label-danger">Python</span>
<span class="label label-warning">PostgreSQL</span>
<span class="label label-success">k-NN Algorithm</span>
<span class="label label-info">pynput / scikit-learn</span>

**Innovation & Outcome:**
[cite_start]The system uses **keystroke dynamics** (typing rhythm biometrics) to create a unique user profile[cite: 433]. [cite_start]It implements the **K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm** for real-time, continuous monitoring, detecting anomalies, and preventing unauthorized data access or modification within an active session[cite: 435, 456, 651].

## Continuing Projects

### Cloud Security Monitoring (AWS/Azure)
**Goal:** Integrate cloud environment logs (e.g., S3/Blob storage access) into a central SIEM platform for unified visibility.

### Automated Vulnerability Scanning
**Goal:** Implement a recurring vulnerability assessment workflow using tools like OpenVAS or Nessus to continuously audit internal infrastructure.

## Lab Challenges & CTF (TryHackMe & HTB)

### Active Challenges
* **TryHackMe:** Currently focusing on the **SOC Level 1 Path** (Focusing on network analysis and SIEM fundamentals).
* **CTF Focus:** Practicing common web application vulnerabilities (Injection, XSS) and basic privilege escalation techniques.
