My passion for network security and digital forensics led me to earn a degree in Computer Security and Forensics from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology. This academic foundation has equipped me with strong core knowledge in networking principles,information security concepts and The world of Digital Forensics.

I am currently training to become a Network Security and Forensics Analyst, with a focus on mastering advanced security operations, system monitoring, and infrastructure protection.

I go beyond theory by building home labs that supports interactions with networking devices,actively analyzing network traffic for vulnerabilities and working on labs and case studies that supports exposure and skills building in forensics invvestigations . My primary technical interests lie in **SIEM tools**, **network monitoring**, and **vulnerability assessment**, **incident response and investigations**.
