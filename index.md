**About Me**;
 
My passion for network security and digital forensics led me to earn a degree in Computer Security and Forensics from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology. This academic foundation has equipped me with strong core knowledge in networking principles,information security concepts and The world of Digital Forensics.

I am currently training to become a Network Security and Forensics Analyst, with a focus on mastering advanced security operations, system monitoring, and infrastructure protection.

I thrive on opportunities that foster research, networking, and learning from experts, ensuring my skills align with the latest industry trends and best practices for delivering quality security services through internship or entry-level role where I can contribute and further develop my technical skills, and help protect critical assets.
